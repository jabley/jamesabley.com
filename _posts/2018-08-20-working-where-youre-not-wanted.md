*This is part of [the Organisation Cultures series](/organisation-cultures/)*.

Sparked by a too brief chat with [Andrew][andrew] at [OneTeamGov Global][OneTeamGovGlobal].

They want people challenging existing systems, and improving things.

And that means it feels absolutely fantastic to work in those places.
