Software engineering is a broad field, with many different specialisms. I tend to consider 4 distinct roles. None of these roles are more senior than the other. These are explicitly specialisms, not a hierarchy. There is no right way to be an engineer. You can be one or more of these things, with more thrown in.

## Backend engineer

Backend engineers create APIs for others to consume. Typically strong domain modellers, they are up-to-date with latest thinking about REST, binary protocols, API chattiness, and data storage.

## Frontend engineer

Frontend engineers craft user interfaces. Good at breaking down interfaces into semantic components, removing cruft and using design elements to create a smooth experience, with deliberate friction where a user should stop and spend more time. HTML and CSS are their main toys, with a bit of JavaScript thrown in where necessary. But progressive enhancement and accessibility are their mantra.

## Operations engineer

Tools for others, automation, infrastructure as code, PaaS usage, data storage.

## Test engineer

The best testers are sick people. Why would you want to use an API like that? But they will anyway, and help you create a better, more secure product for your users.

## Beware of labels

There are other things outside of these. In some organisations, they may be a distinct role. For others, they'll be a hat that someone wears on occasion.

The boundaries are also fluid. I used to be a backend engineer, became more frontend as I did mobile web stuff, then back to backend, and finally operations.
