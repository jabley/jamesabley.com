Hi,

I have friends at Google. I think Google do really interesting work, and have lots of great people that I would love to work with. I think I would be able to fit in there, and help people succeed.

I'm reluctant to take this conversation further, for a few reasons:

* [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/26/google-gender-discrimination-case-salary-records](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/26/google-gender-discrimination-case-salary-records)
* [https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kzbm4a/employees-anti-diversity-manifesto-goes-internally-viral-at-google](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kzbm4a/employees-anti-diversity-manifesto-goes-internally-viral-at-google)

These things do not give me a good impression of Google's culture.

I'm lucky enough to be in the position where I can be more selective about where I spend my time.

I think I'd prefer to see how the company responds before we see whether it's worth talking more.

All the best,

James
