A placeholder reminding myself what things to look for when evaluating a coding
test submission as part of an interview process.

## Functionality
* Works with the sample provided?
* Works with other valid test cases?
* Deals sensibly with incorrect input?

## Style
* Readable?
* Idiomatic use of language and language features?
* Good use of OO and/or functional constructs?
* Consistent naming?
* Well & consistently formatted, good use of whitespace?
* No inappropriate hard coding?

## Structure
* Broken into pieces?
* Separation of concerns?
* Single responsibility (and SOLID in general)?
* Loose coupling?
* Domain driven?

## Tests
* Has tests?
* Test driven?
* Unit tests vs. integration tests?
    * Appropriate use of mocking?

## Extras
* Has build script?
    * Extra points for Vagrant or Docker!
* Command line invokable?
* Use of version control?
  * Small, frequent commits?
  * Commit messages tell a narrative?
