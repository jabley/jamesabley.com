  - "GOV.UK is a breakthrough approach within government to building digital services that are so good citizens prefer to use them."
  - "This talk will look at multi-award winning GOV.UK, how and why it was built by a collaborative, cross-disciplinary team at the Government Digital Service (GDS), and share how the team works. It will cover the technology choices, how we revisited those choices along the way, why we've chosen to reject the traditional government option of large vendor stacks, the open-source culture and how we code in the open, the tools used and architecture of the website, the benefits (tens of millions of pounds saved), how others have built upon our work and what it's like to work at a startup growing at a massive pace in a government environment."
